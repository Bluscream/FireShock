## Summary
FireShock allows you to use a wired DualShock controller with any [Raw Input](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms645543(v=vs.85).aspx), [DirectInput](https://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/windows/desktop/ee418273(v=vs.85)) or ([with additional drivers](../../../ViGEm)) [XInput](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ee417001(v=vs.85).aspx) compatible application/game. It's a Windows Filter Driver which sits between `HIDUSB.SYS` and the USB PDO exposed by the USB hub taking care of the necessary modifications to ensure proper HID compatibility. With this driver the DualShock becomes transparently useable by Windows like any other USB gamepad.

## How it works
Once installed the `fireshock.sys` filter driver will be loaded into the driver stack of any compatible DualShock 3 or 4 controller connected to the system via USB. It sits under `HIDUSB.SYS` and monitors/intercepts the URBs sent from `HIDUSB.SYS` to the USB PDO.

If a DualShock 3 gets connected to the USB hub, the filter will inject a modified configuration and HID report descriptor which describes a button and axis layout similar to the DualShock 4. After the USB device was successfully initialized it sends a "magic" start packet to the _control endpoint_ so the controller will continously start sending HID input reports via the _interrupt in endpoint_ on interface 0. If an _interrupt in_ transfer was requested, the request gets sent down to the USB PDO, the result intercepted and translated by the filter and completed. If an _interrupt out_ (e.g. rumble state change) transfer was requested, the request gets converted into an output report and redirected to the _control endpoint_.

If a DualShock 4 gets connected, it enables XInput-Support if [ViGEm](../../../ViGEm) is installed. Same goes for a DualShock 3.

## How to install
Just download the [latest setup](../../releases/latest) and run it. It doesn't matter if you've got your controllers connected during the setup or connect them afterwards.

### Supported systems
The driver is built for and tested with Windows 7 up to Windows 10 x86 and amd64.
